This project is a recipe site where I can keep recipes that I find online or create myself.

I would like the site to have the following features:

    - Administrative login with permissions to add/modify/delete recipes
    - Recipes searchable by ingredients and/or title
    - Ability to "like" a recipe
    - Separate fields for quantity, unit, ingredient, directions, source
    - Ability to modify quantity and unit based on servings desired
    - Ability to show nutritional information
    - Ability to search site first then search web for recipe
    - Ability to add link to recipe from web search
    - Ability to add new categories as needed
    - Ability to add photos
    - Ability to link recipes to other recipes
